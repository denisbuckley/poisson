You are right to point that out. My apologies; I mistakenly included correlations from a different run. The correlations from the most recent script and plot are indeed different.
Here is the correct analysis and interpretation based on the latest data and script.


Probability Flight Completed

The strongest dependencies for the probability of a successful flight are:
	1	Thermal Density (per km^2): A positive correlation of 0.63. This indicates that a higher density of thermals is moderately associated with a higher probability of success.
	2	Avg Speed Made Good (km/h): A positive correlation of 0.24. Flights that achieve a higher average speed also tend to have a higher probability of completion.
	3	Avg Rate of Climb (m/s): A positive correlation of 0.19. A faster average rate of climb is weakly associated with a higher probability.
	4	Thermal Strength Lambda: A positive correlation of 0.19. Stronger thermals are slightly associated with a higher probability of success.
	5	MC_SNIFF_BAND1 (m/s): A negative correlation of −0.24. A slower sniff band speed for the first band is moderately associated with a higher probability.
	6	MC_SNIFF_BAND2 (m/s): A negative correlation of −0.28. A slower sniff band speed for the second band is moderately associated with a higher probability.
	7	Avg Total Height Climbed (m): A negative correlation of −0.37. Flights with a higher probability of success are associated with less overall height climbed.
	8	Avg Total Climbing Time (s): A negative correlation of −0.42. This indicates that shorter climbing times are moderately associated with a higher probability of success.


Average Speed Made Good

The strongest dependencies for the average speed of the aircraft are:
	1	Avg Rate of Climb (m/s): A very strong positive correlation of 0.93. This means that a higher average rate of climb is the most significant factor for achieving a greater average speed.
	2	Thermal Strength Lambda: A strong positive correlation of 0.81. Stronger thermals are highly associated with a faster average speed.
	3	Avg Total Height Climbed (m): A positive correlation of 0.31. Flights that climb to a greater total height are slightly associated with a faster average speed.
	4	MC_SNIFF_BAND1 (m/s): A positive correlation of 0.25. A faster sniffing speed for the first band is slightly associated with a higher average speed.
	5	Probability: A positive correlation of 0.24. A higher probability of a successful flight is slightly associated with a higher average speed.
	6	Thermal Density (per km^2): A positive correlation of 0.17. A higher density of thermals is weakly associated with a faster average speed.
	7	Avg Total Gliding Time (s): A moderate negative correlation of −0.54. This suggests that flights with shorter gliding times are associated with a higher average speed. This is surprising and suggests a strategy where longer glides might not be optimal for speed.
	8	Avg Total Climbing Time (s): A strong negative correlation of −0.65. A shorter climbing time is strongly associated with a higher average speed. This points to a strategy where minimizing time spent climbing in thermals and maximizing speed is the goal.
